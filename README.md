# ðŸ‘½ Alien Dictionary Solver

A web-based interactive tool that determines the order of characters in an alien language from a sorted list of words. This project uses **topological sorting** to derive the correct lexicographical order based on word comparisons.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In an alien language, we don't know the order of letters. Given a sorted list of words from this language, the task is to determine the possible order of characters that justifies this sorting.

This tool implements the algorithm visually and interactively using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“¥ Input box for entering words (space-separated).
- ðŸ§  Real-time evaluation of the order of characters.
- ðŸš¨ Detects and handles invalid inputs (e.g. prefix conflicts).
- ðŸŽ¨ Clean and modern user interface with responsive layout.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Markup structure
- **CSS3** â€“ Basic styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Core logic for solving and validating the alien character order

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Input Parsing**: Words are read from the text field and split.
2. **Graph Construction**: A directed graph is built where:
   - Each node is a unique character.
   - An edge from `a â†’ b` means `a` comes before `b`.
3. **Topological Sorting**: Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based) is used to determine the character order.
4. **Validation**:
   - Ensures that longer words are not prefixes of shorter ones (`["abc", "ab"]` â†’ invalid).
   - Detects cycles or unresolved dependencies (`Invalid Input` result).
